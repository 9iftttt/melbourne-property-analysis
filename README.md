## 👋 Introduction

### Problem Statement

The Melbourne property market is at a crossroads, marked by conflicting forecasts and uncertainty about future trends. Investors, particularly those who have accumulated funds during and after the pandemic, face a dynamic real estate landscape filled with volatility, speculation about market corrections, and uncertainty driven by economic and policy changes. These investors are seeking rigorous, data-driven analysis to confidently allocate their resources, manage long-term risks, and maximise their returns in an environment with no clear consensus on market direction.

Key questions faced by stakeholders include:
- **Will Melbourne's property market continue to grow, or is a correction imminent?**
- **Which suburbs and property types are most resilient to market fluctuations?**
- **How do economic, policy, and demographic factors influence investment outcomes?**
- **Where are the best opportunities for capital growth or stable rental yields?**

### Stakeholders

The primary stakeholders for this project are:
- **Investor Group (Clients of Melbourne Property Insights, MPI):**  
  Sophisticated, risk-aware investors ready to deploy capital into Melbourne’s property market, seeking evidence-based guidance for their investment strategies.
- **Property Analysts & Consultants (MPI Team):**  
  Responsible for delivering robust, actionable insights derived from rigorous data analysis, and ensuring recommendations are grounded in data quality and academic research.
- **Homeowners and Prospective Buyers:**  
  Interested in understanding property value trends and making informed buying decisions.
- **General Public and Policymakers:**  
  Indirectly benefit from improved transparency and understanding of property market drivers.

### Project Approach & Requirement Gathering

To meet stakeholder needs and address the complex challenges of the Melbourne property market, the following steps were undertaken:

1. **Understanding Client Concerns & Objectives**  
   During the initial requirement-gathering phase, I engaged with the investor group (the project client) to identify their critical concerns—market volatility, location attractiveness, investment resilience, and risk mitigation. I translated these needs into a focused set of analysis questions and deliverables.

2. **Data Acquisition & Validation**  
   Curated a comprehensive dataset from trusted sources (Consumer Affairs Victoria, Domain.com.au, government open data) to ensure a reliable foundation for analysis. Initial data profiling was performed to assess completeness, consistency, and integrity.

3. **Requirement Specification**  
   Established project deliverables based on stakeholder expectations:
   - Rigorous data quality assessment
   - Insights tailored to investor needs (e.g., location comparison, rental yields, market trends)
   - Visual reporting through Tableau dashboards and an infographic
   - A detailed, professional report including critical data-driven insights and actionable recommendations

4. **Analysis Planning**  
   Developed a plan to address the following core questions:
   - What is the current state and likely direction of the Melbourne property market?
   - Which regions and property types present the best opportunities and lowest risks?
   - How have market dynamics changed post-pandemic, and what factors drive these trends?
   - How can data analytics provide an edge over traditional intuition-based investing?

5. **Continuous Feedback & Refinement**  
   Throughout the process, I solicited feedback from stakeholders to refine analysis focus and visualizations, ensuring alignment with client objectives and the assignment’s academic standards.

### Project Deliverables

- **Comprehensive Data Quality Assessment** to ensure reliable insights and highlight any limitations in the data.
- **Critical Investment Insights** supported by compelling Tableau dashboards, identifying high-yield suburbs, resilient property types, and agency performance.
- **Professional Report & Infographic** summarizing key findings, methodology, and actionable recommendations for investors.
- **Interactive Tableau Workbook** providing a hands-on exploration of the Melbourne property market data and trends.

**By addressing these objectives and following a transparent, stakeholder-driven process, this project empowers investors to make well-informed decisions and navigate Melbourne’s real estate market with clarity and confidence.**

## 🏆 Project Highlights

- **Rental Affordability:** Premium suburbs near the CBD (e.g., Hawthorn, Hughesdale) command high rental prices, while outer suburbs like Laverton and Melton West are more affordable—creating diverse investment opportunities.
- **Location & Property Type Trends:** Proximity to the CBD strongly influences property values and demand; houses dominate within 10km, while units and townhouses offer affordable options slightly further out.
- **Agency Specialization:** Suburb-level analysis (e.g., Hawthorn) reveals which real estate agencies excel in selling specific property types, helping investors choose effective partners.
- **Regional Rental Trends:** Western and Northern suburbs cluster affordable rentals; Southern and Eastern suburbs demand higher rents due to central amenities and access.

**Key Steps in the Cleaning Process:**
- Duplicate checking and removal across all tables
- Handling NULL values with imputation (e.g., using median values)
- Consistency checks (e.g., region, suburb names, property types)
- Data validation (e.g., correcting misspellings, verifying postcodes)
- Field standardization and final table joins for analysis
